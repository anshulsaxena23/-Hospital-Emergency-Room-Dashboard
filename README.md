🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard 🚑

I'm excited to present my latest Power BI project on the healthcare industry - a Hospital Emergency Room (ER) dashboard! This interactive tool provides a comprehensive view of key metrics, empowering data-driven decisions to enhance patient care and optimize emergency services.

* Key Highlights:

🏥 Total Number of Patients: 9,216 - This dashboard provides insights into a significant patient population, allowing for the identification of trends and areas for improvement.

⏱️ Average Wait Time: 35.26 minutes - Identifying opportunities to reduce this wait time could significantly improve patient satisfaction and outcomes.

🌟 Patient Satisfaction Score: 4.99/5 - Maintaining such high satisfaction is commendable! Analyzing factors contributing to this score can help replicate success in other areas.

🏷️ Patient Admission Status, ⏳ % of Patients Seen Within 30 Minutes, 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ % of Patients by Gender, 🌍 Number of Patients by Race, 🏥 Department Referral Insights, 📅⏰ Patient Volume by Day & Hour - All these metrics provide a holistic view of ER operations.

• Interactive Slicers:

📅 Year Selector – Filter data by year to track trends over time.

📆 Month Selector – Quickly analyze data by month for a deeper understanding of seasonal patterns and performance.

The dashboard is organized into three easy-to-navigate views:

📊 Monthly View

📈 Consolidated View

📑 Patient Details Report

I leveraged the power of DAX in Power BI to create calculated measures and ensure data accuracy for robust analysis and Data Modeling. This dashboard empowers hospital administrators, healthcare professionals, and decision-makers to optimize emergency care, streamline processes, and ensure timely service delivery.
